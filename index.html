    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>The Earth is the third planet in our solar system and is the only one that can support life. It is able to do this due to the crust being 70% water. The word Earth comes from eighth century Anglo-Saxon word, erda. This word translates to ground or soil. A day on Earth is 24 hours long and there are 365.25 days in a year(.25 due to every four years being a leap year).</p>
